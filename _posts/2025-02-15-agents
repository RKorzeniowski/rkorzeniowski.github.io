# Why are Agents so hot?

Agents are the hot topic of recent days? Why is that? The main use case for AI so far (at least till 2024 before chatbots 
got agentified with tools) was this type of assistant that helps you solve simple problems you throw at it. 
It is very knowledgeable but as soon as you ask it to do something that requires a bit of common sense and "googling" 
it fails miserably. Either making things up or providing inaccurate information. Let's take as an example trip planning

When asked to come up with itinerary with estimated budget for trip in a week we can expect AI will give us made up 
flights with price estimate unrelated to current price (and let's not dream about it finding best deal for us), 
types of attractions a list of most typical activities not necessarily available at the time of our trip and so on.
If we "digest it a little bit" and ask for specific season it will usually do a little better but still might recommend
things that were closed. I will later talk about how agentic approach addresses some of these issues.

More recently companies stated a goal of automating junior developers. Copilot etc. 
There was significant progress in this field. From AI having a hard time writing doc strings, 
through tests being written just based on test  docstring written by developer and interfaces and existing codebase, 
to most recently impressive improvements to existing algorithms and coming up with new ones (EvolveAlpha). 
Last one being more about blend of evolutionary algorithms and ? but agentic concept that happened along the way and 
how they impacted the dynamic are still interesting.

Finally the most recent document released by Google proposing the concept of an independent "agentic contractor" 
and explaining how multi agent fits into the picture.

All of the above developments motivated me to refresh and extend my vocabulary and understanding. 
So in this post I'll be going over 1) what are agents and most basic concepts related to them 2) how do they differ 
from standard chatbots 3) why multi agent approach and defining contracts is such a big deal 4) go over concrete example 
using CrewAI to explain how above mentioned concepts play together

## How agent differs from chatbot?
Well, this is a bit of an ill posed question but I think this is something that can be easily confused. 
Chatbots can be agentic. Chatbot is w use case while agent is solution paradigma. So there are agentic and 
non-agentic chatbots. The agentic systems are characterized by an ability to interact with the environment using tools.

Tool can be anything. From simple things like calculator (yes, they come in handy even for LLMs) 
to quite an advance like a web browser.

They allow for dynamic input that is not easy to "remember" and is usually not available in the input prompt. 
You can probably already see how having a web browser that will  return most up to date price for flight ticket 
for any date requested makes life of an LLM much easier

The problem is that even with amazing tools our LLM will still struggle with coming up with the idea to ask tool for this 
information (idea of Chain of thought will help us here but let's ignore it for now) in the first place and with an 
abundance of information provided to it. This is where the concept of multiple agents comes in with decomposition and 
orchestration

(agent consists of brain -> LLM that gives it a way to think, tools that "brain" can use, and orchestration if we talk about
more than single agent)
