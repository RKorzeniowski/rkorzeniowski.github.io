- problem statement
- S2S componenets

- TTS
  - why Vocoders are outdated
  - find papers with motivation for going to discret for diversity
  - find new papers about going from discrete to continues to gain fidelity
  - tldr attn_based one-to-many mapping problem + unstable when scaling and limited latent?, transformers can't get continues inputs like melspectrograms, 
  idea! let's quantize them with RVQs (GAN paper, Tortoise, sth else?). Transformers produce diverse i.e. expressive speech but 
- ASR
  - how much detail do I want to go here? Any unique aspect from S2S perspective that I can talk about?
  - opposite to TTS as it benefits from noisy speech to be robust. This means hard to get an encoder that works for both
- Encoders (RVQ etc)
  - VQVAE https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937 (issues, blurry upper freq bands. Sound like metalicity. Small from MSE perspective but easy to hear for a human)
  - GAN loss https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06546 (fix -> use GANs to deal with things that MSE has a hard time picking up)
  - discrete survey https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10274
- Duplex
- Challanges
  - need for longer context -> telescoping attention https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19466
  - how to come up with response or call tools without text in the middle?
  - how to deal with latency and real time factor

- good background on RVQ, ASR, TTS https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01299
