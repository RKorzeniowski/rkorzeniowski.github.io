Concerning trend of lower quality invited talks. I was hoping that it's just my subjective experience or odd occurrence but 
I heard from different people on different conferences this year that the level was lower. Since rise in secrecy in industry a lot of 
most interesting done by very talented people is happening behind close doors. This lowers the pool of both topic and peolpe who can 
contribute to those types of open source knowledge sharing sessions.
