# World Models

## What are World Models

A world model is a model that learns to represent how the environment evolves in space, time and under actions. 
It often predicts future states or rewards of actions. They are often used in RL, simulations, planning, robotics and most
recently peaked my intrest with the release of [genie-3](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/)
that creates stunning interactive environments from short textual prompts. 

Key concepts for world models are: representation learning, dynamics modeling and dealing with 
estimating impact of actor actions on the environment. 

## Why are World Models exciting

They enable exciting new directions like embodied reasoning. 
Include examples of most recent results. 

## Background

Before we get into World Models we need to cover some concepts crucial for understanding how all the compoenents come together. I want to keep this post focused 
on World Models so following explanations will more about giving relevant intuition and links to resources for study than detailed explanation. 

### Representation Learning

Quickly mention CNN and RNN here. 

### Reinforcement Learning

[RL refresher](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-02-19-rl-overview/) or UC Berkeleyâ€™s CS285

### Dynamics Modeling



## Evolution of World Models

(add diagram)

Work [World Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10122) is one of the earlier works that clearly illustrates what is a world model.  
It uses VAE (add link) to encode compact image representation, then models temporal dynamics with an RNN (add link) and trains a controller that gives
actor tools to interact with the environment. It even utilizes to use created environment to train downstream ML models. 

Next interesting work is [Recurrent World Models Facilitate Policy Evolutio](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.01999) that extends 
the work with insights on how compact policies can work with learned features and dynamics. 

[Contrastive Learning of Structured World Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.12247) adds compositional structure of objects and 
relations with contrastive learning (explain later).
